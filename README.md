Hi, I'm Beth! I have been an Oracle Database Administrator since August 2020 and I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science in Sept 2021 from Western Governors University. My passions include coding, astronomy, and the outdoors! 


 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge and skills in Python, after which I would then like to practice more C++ and Java.
